# Contributing


Since you study Comp Ling, it's your responsibility to know git. ðŸ˜Ž  

That means if you want to contribute you can open a pull request, and I'll merge it.
If you are a frequent contributer I can also give you push access. 


## OMG that's too hard

(How to make a pull request)[https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request]

## I can't read!!!

If you are still unfamiliar with git, you can also open an issue with what you want added, and I'll manually add it for you.
