## Agenda

## Important
- Assign someone mail duties
  - We have had several mails that were not properly answered on time and we would like to avoid this situation

- Assign more responsibilty to other members in general
  - Have more people update the website
  - Set up the calendar for next semester
  - Finish the erasmus page with someone who knows what is going up. 


## Extra
-  Experiment with Sponsorship

  - Maybe change our email to something that is more recognizable (see other fachschaft which are not random letters)
  - Something with tech or others to potentially host our minecraft server. 
  
- Official Minecraft server?

- Next semester prep
  - Setup ersties groupchat
  - Maybe setup a general first semester welcome back party or something (Somebody who wants)
  - Recruit more members for Fachschaft next semester

# Meeting


**Present: John, Bo**

- Going over the mails together
    - More than one person one time. 
    - Bo has sent emails, and we are finally getting reinbursed for our bills yay. 
    - Post about Illsa mail that we got, John can post in website, Bo can advertise on social media
    - For now we will go over emails together, though it would be nice to assign someone responsibilty, in case we cancel meetings. For now, John will take the over the blame if we fail :(. 
    
- Responsibilty to other members
  - Not enough people showing up again
  - Problemetic, as we do not have enough ersties to continue
  - Again nice to have someone else update the website so it doesn't get stale. 
  - Push this topic to maybe next meeting. 
  - (Urgent, mabye come up with recruiting, maybe advertise in our groups, to just )
- Guest from potential student
  - How could we entice students to come to Fachschaft, coming from a future student. 
  - Enjoys social events, and knowledge exchanging. 
  - Research idea discussions? 
  - Coffee, trips, sports events? 
  - Make Whats app for a new groupchat, since it doesn't hurt to start early. 
- Bo asks for sponsorship. Maybe ask tech companies, for free stuff. 
- Worst comes to worst just do bar crawls.
