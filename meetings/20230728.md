## Agenda
## Tutorials


- Before we reserve room, we need
  - Room capacity, so figure out how many people are planning to come
  - At what time would be the best, and for how long
    - Propose maybe just do an hour a day and then get lunch together?
- Finalize topics/general domain, so we can get contracts and people to teach.

### Topics

#### Technical Topics
- Git
- What an ide is
- Download VS Code
- Basic Commandline
- Debugging examples

#### Living topics 
- What studying is like 
- student life is like
- What resources you have available
- General tips for being in the major
- Studying hacks

## Experiment with Sponsorship

- Maybe change our email to something that is more recognizable (see other fachschaft which are not random letters)
- Something with tech or others to potentially host our minecraft server. 



## Assign more responsibility

- Have more people update the website
  - Set up the calendar for next semester
  - Finish the erasmus page with someone who knows what is going up. 

# Meeting


**Present: John**


- Tutorials
  - As there is nobody here to discuss, I will assume that 30 people will be enough, and for two hours everyday for week. 
  - Maybe 10AM to 12PM for the week. 
  
  - I will send email. 
  - I will give everyone one week to decide if they want respond to teaching courses. 
  - Topics will be decided later, but as there is no feedback, I will assume the current list will be enough. We can decide how we want to divide it later, once we know how many people will show up. 
- Sponsorship
  - At the BBP meeting we learned about potentially getting a sponsorship. If someone has interest, investigate tech companies around and see if they are interested in sponsoring us. 
- More Responsability 
  - There is nobody here so it's hard to ask anyone if they would like to share responsibility. However, I will ask in the chat to see if anybody would want to add information on erasmus, and maybe ask personal members.
