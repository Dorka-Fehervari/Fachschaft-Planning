# Contributing

Since you study Comp Ling, it's your responsibility to know git. ðŸ˜Ž  

That means if you want to contribute you can open a pull request, and I'll merge it.
If you are a frequent contributer I can also give you push access. 

(If you are still unfamiliar with git, you can also open an issue, and I'll manually add it).
