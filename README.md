  - Have more people update the website
  - Set up the calendar for next semester
  - Finish the erasmus page with someone who knows what is going up. 
  
  


## Extra

  - Maybe change our email to something that is more recognizable (see other fachschaft which are not random letters)
  - Something with tech or others to potentially host our minecraft server.
